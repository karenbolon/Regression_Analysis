# Regression_Analysis
Applied regression analysis on Capital Bike Share dataset

# [Project: Capital Bike Sharing](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_03_project)

* Built and trained a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data), in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather
* Imported and cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas

* Performed Data Engineering using Pipelines, ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, and RobustScaler
* Trained regression models (Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression with Cross Validation) to find the best Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)  
* Used ElasticNet to regularise the model
* Used Hyperparameter Optimization on Random Forest Regression Model and GridSearchCV
